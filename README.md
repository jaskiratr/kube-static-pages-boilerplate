# Kube Static Pages Generator

I created this quick boilerplate because I love writing code in Pug and Kube CSS & JS Framework. This boilerplate is great to build quick prototypes.

### Features
- Pug Templating
- [Kube CSS](https://imperavi.com/kube/)
- Gulp
- BrowserSync

### Getting Started

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jaskiratr/kube-static-pages-boilerplate
npm install
gulp
```
